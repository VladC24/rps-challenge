# RPS Challenge

Task
----

The Makers Academy Marketing Array ( **MAMA** ) have asked us to provide a game for them. Their daily grind is pretty tough and they need time to steam a little.

My task was to provide a _Rock, Paper, Scissors_ game for them so they can play on the web with the following user stories:

```
As a marketeer
So that I can see my name in lights
I would like to register my name before playing an online game
```
```
As a marketeer
So that I can enjoy myself away from the daily grind
I would like to be able to play rock/paper/scissors
```

## Instructions for running the app.

* Clone this repo
```
git clone https://github.com/VladC24/rps-challenge.git
```

> In the terminal, do the following:

* Go to the folder

```
cd rps-challenge
```

* ```
bundle
```

* ```
rackup
```

* Go to your browser and enter in the address bar
```
localhost:9292
```

## Basic Rules

- Rock beats Scissors
- Scissors beats Paper
- Paper beats Rock

### HAVE FUN!!!
